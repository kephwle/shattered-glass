 Hello! You can call me Maria or Kim- my sbilings gave me the "Mars" nickname </3 ! (Your choice)

 I prefer both salt and sweet, my favs are pizza n donuts :P (cheesecake too!!)
 I like the dark, more specifically the night! I define myself as an owl. I also love swimming, so a fish!

 || I'm italian, half filo (I don't speak much tagalog..) || English can be terrible cause I either don't focus or there's music playing.
 
 NUMEROUS amount of error spellings / doing it on purpose for fun, or just my typing
