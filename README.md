I can take up 30 mins - 1 hour max when making an outfit ──── ୨୧ ──── please Do not Cover/Copy.
If my pony doesn't have "c+h".. you still can cuddle with me, there's no problem at all!! Hugs are welcomed by everyone, except Kpop Demon Hunter players.

I AM HONOURED WHENEVER YOU WHISPER THE CROWN!! I try my best to shade perfectly, I installed Pony Town less than 4 weeks ago.
- Most of my ponies are old, so when you catch me with a hideous fit, DON'T JUDGE ( ˶°ㅁ°) !!

- Yep, I go insanely crazy when Sonic, Honkai Star Rail, Genshin Impact, PJSK, My Little Pony, Cookie Run: Kingdom, Precure, Lolirock, FNAF, FNF, Teen Titans (GO) are mentioned (except the fact I may or may have not realized I left some of these, however it'll be cool if you're part of one of them ((can be multiple)) and update me on things I've missed on! :D) ʚ♡ɞ

- Also, if you mention a fandom that I don't know, then I apologize! I mostly focus on the first two written above.

Some facts about me: I am 14+, the more I talk with someone, the more I get weirder. Spice is the love of my life ˖ ᡣ𐭩 ⊹ ࣪  ౨ৎ˚₊  --------- > catching stars alone? I'm here <3 
If you're sensitive in a few specific topics, such as adult, creepy, gore etc.. you can simply tell me ^^ btw, I suck at comforting people so don't go after me :V
