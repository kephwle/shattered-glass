If my pony doesn't have "c+h".. you still can cuddle with me, there's no problem at all!! Hugs are welcomed by everyone, except Kpop Demon Hunter players.

I AM HONOURED WHENEVER YOU WHISPER THE CROWN!! I try my best to shade perfectly, I installed Pony Town less than 4 weeks ago.
𖹭 Most of my ponies are old, so when you catch me with a hideous fit, DON'T JUDGE ( ˶°ㅁ°) !!

𖹭 Yep, I go insanely crazy when Sonic, Honkai Star Rail, Genshin Impact, PJSK, My Little Pony, Cookie Run: Kingdom, Precure, Lolirock, FNAF, FNF, Teen Titans (GO) are mentioned (except the fact I may or may have not realized I left some of these, but it's cool if you're part of one of them ((can be multiple)) and update me on things I've missed on! :D) ʚ♡ɞ

𖹭 Also, if you mention a fandom that I don't know, then I apologize! I mostly focus on the first two written above.

Some facts about me: the more I talk with someone, the more I get weirder. Spice is the love of my life ˖ ᡣ𐭩 ⊹ ࣪  ౨ৎ˚₊  --------- > catching stars alone? I'm here <3 
If you're sensitive in a few specific topics, such as adult, creepy, gore etc.. you can simply tell me ^^ btw, I suck at comforting people so don't go after me :V

𖹭 🪼⋆.ೃ࿔*:･ I AM A CAT ADDICT AND LOVER!!! THEY'RE SO CUTE! Dogs are adorable aswell, sadly I... do not support SOME of its breeds. 🪼⋆.ೃ࿔*:･

₊˚⊹ ᰔ As a multishipper, I totally respect most of the ships. But in Sonic..? I am extremely sorry for the ones reading this:
  -------------------------- ✮ ⋆ ˚｡𖦹 ⋆｡°✩ -------------------------------
  𖤝 ShadAmy. I don't get it tbh.. I know, maybe it's their opposites that makes them a pretty popular ship? All coquette and the other's edgy. Still a massive no...
  𖤝 Sontails. No explanation needed.
  𖤝 KnuxAmy. Another nonsense.. I see them as siblings
  𖤝 1/2 SONADOW. I, myelf, ship them because they're cute, but there's an actual reason on why I've put it in here.. it's the FANARTS! Why draw Sonic OOC, and Shadow like he just drank a whole ahh pack of protein? That's stupid. I'd like to name one of the artists.. @ShaddyCatz. Just like I've earlier, don't investigate since it has a bit of adult content.
  𖤝 Shadtails | Shadream | Shadaria. DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN, HUH?!

Take your time, relax, shoulder soft and body calm.
. This is my first time making a repository like this, it's fun imo! (˶ˆᗜˆ˵) . 
Sometimes I don't pay attention on what I'm typing so I can actually mess up my text- (+ my english can be terrible)
